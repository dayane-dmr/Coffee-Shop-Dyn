This is a simple web project created as an initial experiment with **CSS transitions** and **vanilla JavaScript**. The goal of the project is to practice creating interactive UI elements without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## Features

- **Video background:** Subtle looping video in the hero section.  
- **Image carousel:** Smooth slide transitions between images using vanilla JS.  
- **Overlay effect:** Semi-transparent overlay on images for better text readability.  
- **Responsive layout:** Flexbox-based layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.  
- **About section:** Text and background image with overlay, centered vertically and horizontally.  
- **Interactive buttons:** Navigation controls for the carousel and "Learn more" button.
